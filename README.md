# Model Mapper 

Model Mapper for dart is an object mapping library that automatically maps objects to each other. It uses a convention based approach while providing a simple refactoring safe API for handling specific use cases. 

This package was inspired in the ModelMapper for Java. Visit [modelmapper.org](http://modelmapper.org) to learn more.


## Why I need this?
Applications often consist of similar but different object models, where the data in two models may be similar but the structure and concerns of the models are different. Object mapping makes it easy to convert one model to another, allowing separate models to remain segregated.

The goal of ModelMapper is to make object mapping easy, by automatically determining how one object model maps to another, based on conventions, in the same way that a human would - while providing a simple, refactoring-safe API for handling specific use cases.


### Advantages
- Easy to use; 
- Remove boilerplate of your code;
- Use functions for transform data between the objects;
- You can create model specifically for your API and convert it to the your APP Entities.
- The ModelMapper introspect and analyze the data type between field models and automatically convert the data.
